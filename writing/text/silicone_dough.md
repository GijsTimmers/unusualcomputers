# Notes on silicone dough/oogoo/home-made sugru

An excellent material for wrapping up electronics, a mouldable play-dough like stuff that dries into rubbery elastic substance. There are versions of this you can buy, most notably Sugru, but it comes in small expensive bags. You can make it for next to nothing and it works really well. 

There is many references, descriptions and clips online, search for 'home-made sugru', 'oogoo', 'proto-putty'. Definitely the most detailed and well researched one is by mikey77 on [instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-To-Make-Your-Own-Sugru-Substitute/). mikey77 gives detailed instructions and recipes for various consistencies, colours, modifications and good explanations of what goes on. 

To start with though, it's so simple you can just have a go.

Get some silicone paste/caulk. This is stuff used for bathroom sealants and such, any diy store will have it. Go for the cheapest one, not only to save money, it is also almost certainly the purest silicone paste with no fancy additives that may spoil it. 
Get some corn flour/corn starch/starch, different names depending on where you live. 

Find an old can, paper cup, old something you don't mind messing up, pour in some silicone stuff, add corn flour and mix it with a stick. When it starts looking like dough, check out how sticky it is, and add more of one or the other if need be. When good it's like play-dough and you can just mould it. It will stick to anything. You have about five minutes to do it, quite a bit of time really.

Two things to remember:
* do not lean over it while mixing, it releases gas in blobs that stinks to high heavens and won't hurt you but will make you cough if you breathe it in

* wear something on your hands while it's still soft, rubber gloves, plastic bag... before it becomes doughy it's a bastard to wash off (if you do get your hands soaked in it while it's still gooey, abrasive detergents work the best, washing machine stuff, still takes ages to remove though).

Drop in a bit of paint too if you like, apparently linseed oil based ones are best, but almost anything should work.
